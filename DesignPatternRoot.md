## Creational Pattern
Provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Structural Pattern
Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keep these structures flexible and efficient. **It is trying to solve design problems related to the composition of classes and objects, rather than the algorithms or the behavior of individual classes**, like the Adapter Pattern is trying to allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.

## Behavioral Pattern
Are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
